Cactus Code Thorn MHD_Diagnostics ( based on smallbPoynET )

Author(s)    : Michail Chabanov, Zachariah B. Etienne
Note         : Using HydroBase velocity and magnetic field variables, as
               well as ADMBase spacetime metric variables, smallbPoynET
               computes b^i, b^2, and three spatial components of Poynting
               flux. It also computes (-1-u_0), which is useful for
               tracking unbound matter.
               The current version of this thorn is destined to be replaced
               by the NRPy+ version documented and coded here:
